The codebase for the chat application with Server-Sent Events (SSE) contains several important files that define its structure and functionality. Here's a brief overview of the key files:

1. **server.js**: This is likely the main server file, containing the Node.js code that sets up and runs the server, including the SSE logic.

2. **package.json**: This file lists the dependencies and may include scripts for running and testing the application.

3. **Dockerfile**: Used for creating a Docker container for the application, indicating that the app is designed to be run in a containerized environment.

4. **.env**: Contains environment variables that are crucial for the application's configuration.

Based on this structure, here's a draft for the `README.md`:
